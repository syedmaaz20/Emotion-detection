This project implements an Emotion Detection system that identifies the emotional state of a user based on input data. The system can classify emotions like happy, sad, neutral, angry, and more based on facial expressions. The core of the system is built using machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize and categorize emotions in real-time.
